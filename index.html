  <h2>Prime Pantry</h2>
  <p>
In April 2014, Amazon began a service for shipping non-perishable grocery store items into a single box for delivery for a fixed fee. The service is available in the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Austria, India, Japan, Italy, Spain and France.
<br>
<br>
The service is available only to customers with Amazon Prime membership to order up to 45 pounds or up to 4 cubic feet of dry goods and non-perishable groceries for a flat delivery fee of $5.99 in the US.
<br>
<br>

An ever-changing but limited variety of products is offered, but the range has decreased since the service was first launched. While selecting items within the Prime Pantry program, each item lists the percentage of space it will take up inside the delivery box. A running total shows how full this box is. The delivery fee remains the same regardless of the filling percentage
<br>
<br>

For $6, Amazon Prime members can have box of "pantries" delivered to their homes. As people shop, Amazon quantifies the space each item takes up so that people can assess the number of boxes needed before check off and shipping.</p>
